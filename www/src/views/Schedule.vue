        <h4>Cherry Blossom Hot 5</h4>
        <p>
            The Cherry Blossom Hot 5 have been playing for swing dancers regularly
            for over two years and continue to broaden their popularity in the scenes
            in Washington as well as here in Oregon.
        </p> 
        
        <img src="../assets/cherry-blossom.jpg" width="100%"/>

        <p>
            Led by an experienced swing dancer and prolific DJ, the band has a unique 
            musical understanding of the ingredients required for the best night's dancing, 
            with a mix of tunes and styles through the 1920s to the 1940s including some 
            of the more iconic renditions of tunes dancers love for the popular choreographed 
            group dances like the Shim Sham and Tranky Doo, and the meaningful tunes such as
            those much loved by the late and great Frankie Manning and Norma Miller.
        </p>

        <p>
            The musicians in the band are stars in their own right, the very top on their 
            instrument, with a long tradition in the style.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            All in all, an exceptional blend to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Prohibition!

        <h4>Stealin' Apples Jazz Band<br/>featuring Jen Hodge</h4>
        <p>
            The Stealin’ Apples Jazz Band is pianist Shane Allen’s love letter to classic, 
            rowdy, four-on-the-floor swing dance music. From a young age Shane has been a
            gigging musician and dedicated student of the jazz tradition, blessed with
            the opportunity to learn from modern giants as well as classic masters. 
        </p>

        <p>
            After years working as a dance accompanist, playing Lindy hop house parties in 
            Minneapolis, and haunting the late night jams at Herräng Dance Camp, he formed
            the Stealin’ Apples Jazz Band to connect the world-class faculty and students
            of the University of Oregon jazz program with lindy hoppers’ passion for authentic
            swing-era dance music.
